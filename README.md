## About
This project was created for the face tracking Mask project. Here are some of the words that inspired me/I aimed to represent in the mask: 

- Moon/Lunar (because I love the moon and space)
- Duality, Exterior vs Interior, Night vs Day (because no one is a flat character)
- Glitch, computer (because I'm a CS major)

I also wanted to include my favorite colors, but it turns out I have a lot of those (pink, blue, purple, and red...)

The mask changes if you open your mouth. Try it out!
